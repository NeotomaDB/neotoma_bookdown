title: Neotoma Paleoecology Database
---

This documentation would not be possible without the extrordinary work
of Dr. Eric C. Grimm who has spent countless hours developing this
manual. In addition, Neotoma rests on the work of a number of
researchers who contributed to the original North American Pollen
Database, and subsequent data contributors, including FAUNMAP
contributors and the data contributions of Allan Ashworth. The Neotoma
Database would not exist were it not for the ongoing contributions of
authors, data analysts and funding agencies, in particular the National
Sciences Foundation. This manual draws heavily from Eric Grimm\'s
original Neotoma manual (v2), published as:

Grimm, E.C., 2008. Neotoma: an ecosystem database for the Pliocene,
Pleistocene, and Holocene. *Illinois State Museum Scientific Papers E
Series, 1*.
