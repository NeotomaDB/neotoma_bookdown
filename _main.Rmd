# Neotoma Paleoecology Database

## Acknowledgements

This documentation would not be possible without the extrordinary work
of Dr. Eric C. Grimm who has spent countless hours developing this
manual. In addition, Neotoma rests on the work of a number of
researchers who contributed to the original North American Pollen
Database, and subsequent data contributors, including FAUNMAP
contributors and the data contributions of Allan Ashworth. The Neotoma
Database would not exist were it not for the ongoing contributions of
authors, data analysts and funding agencies, in particular the National
Sciences Foundation. This manual draws heavily from Eric Grimm's
original Neotoma manual (v2), published as [@grimm2008neotoma].

# Introduction

Neotoma is a public database containing fossil data from the Holocene,
Pleistocene, and Pliocene, or approximately the last 5.3 million years.
The database stores associated physical data from fossil bearing
deposits, for example sediment loss-on-ignition and geochemical data.
The database also stores data from modern samples that are used to
interpret fossil data.

The initial development of Neotoma was funded by a grant from the U.S.
National Science Foundation Geoinformatics program. This grant is
collaborative between Penn State University[^1] and the Illinois State
Museum[^2]. It has five Principle Investigators, Russell W. Graham, Eric
C. Grimm, Stephen T. Jackson, Allan C. Ashworth, and John W. (Jack)
Williams. The database is served from the Center for Environmental
Informatics at Penn State University.

Initially, data were merged from four existing databases: the
Global Pollen Database, FAUNMAP (a database of mammalian fauna), the
North American Plant Macrofossil Database, and a fossil beetle database
assembled by Allan Ashworth. The design of this database is such that
many other kinds of fossil data can easily be incorporated in the
future, for example, the addition of ostracode, diatom, chironmid, and
freshwater mussel datasets.

The existing databases were developed in the 1990's and had not been
updated structurally since. New data have been added, but the structures
of these databases have not changed, despite significant advances in
database and internet technology. Although structurally different, these
databases contain similar kinds of data, and merging them was quite
practical. The rationale for this merging was twofold: (1) to facilitate
analyses of past biotic communities at the ecosystem level and (2) to
reduce the overhead in maintaining and distributing several independent
databases.

The new Neotoma database was initially designed by E. C. Grimm and
implemented in Microsoft® Access®. This database was ported to SQL Server, and subsequently to PostgreSQL for Internet distribution through and Application-Program Interface that can be integrated into R packages [@goring2015neotoma] or other programming languages.

## Whence Neotoma

In the original NSF proposal, Neotoma was called a "Late Neogene
Terrestrial Ecosystem Database." At the time this proposal was written,
the Neogene Period included the Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, and
Holocene epochs. However, a proposal before the International Commission
on Stratigraphy would elevate the Quaternary to a System or Period
following the Neogene and terminate the Neogene at the end of Pliocene.

Because this proposal renders the Neogene description of this database
obsolete, a new name was sought. Numerous names and companion acronyms
were considered, but none engendered enthusiastic support. B. Brandon
Curry proposed the name Neotoma, and this name struck a fancy. *Neotoma*
is the genus for the packrat. Packrats are prodigious collectors of
anything in their territory, and moreover they are collectors of fossil
data. They collect plant macrofossils and bones, and pollen is preserved
in their amberat---hardened, dried urine, which impregnates their
middens and preserves them for millennia.

## Rationale

Paleobiological data from the recent geological past have been
invaluable for understanding ecological dynamics at timescales
inaccessible to direct observation, including ecosystem evolution,
contemporary patterns of biodiversity, principles of ecosystem
organization, particularly the individualistic response of species to
environmental gradients, and the biotic response to climatic change,
both gradual and abrupt. Understanding the dynamics of ecological
systems requires ecological time series, but many ecological processes
operate too slowly to be amenable to experimentation or direct
observation. In addition to having ecological significance, fossil data
have tremendous importance for climatology and global change research.
Fossil floral and faunal data are crucial for climate-model verification
and are essential for elucidating climate-vegetation interactions that
may partly control climate.

Basic paleobiological research is site based, and paleobiologists have
devoted innumerable hours to identifying, counting, and cataloging
fossils from cores, sections, and excavations. These data are typically
published in papers describing single sites or small numbers of sites.
Often, the data are published graphically, as in a pollen diagram, and
the actual data reside on the investigator's computer or in a file
cabinet. These basic data are similar to museum collections, costly to
replace, sometimes irreplaceable, and their value does not diminish with
time. Also similar to museum collections, the data require cataloging
and curation. Whereas physical specimens of large fossils, such as
animal bones, are typically accessioned into museums, microfossils, such
as pollen, are not accessioned, and the digital data are the primary
objects, and their loss is equivalent to losing valuable museum
specimens. The integrated database that we propose ensures safe,
long-term archiving of these data.

Large independent databases exist for fossil pollen, plant macrofossils,
and mammals: the Global Pollen Database (GPD), the North American Plant
Macrofossil Database (NAPMD), and FAUNMAP. In addition, a database of
fossil beetles (BEETLE) has been assembled, but it is not yet publicly
available. These databases have become essential cyberinfrastructure.
Nevertheless, they were developed as standalone databases in the early
1990's with PC database software. GPD and NAPMD are in Paradox®; FAUNMAP
is in Access. Since initial database development, emphasis has been
placed on ingest of new and legacy data. However, database and Internet
technology have advanced greatly in the past 15 years, and the current
relational database software, ingest programs, data retrieval
algorithms, output formats, and analysis tools are outdated and minimal.
Moreover, the databases are not linked, so that integrated analyses are
difficult.

Although GPD, NAPMD, and FAUNMAP were developed independently, they have
much in common. The basic data of all three databases as well as BEETLE
are essentially lists of taxa from cores, excavations, or sections,
often with quantitative measures of abundance. The three databases
include similar metadata. The objective of Neotoma is to build a unified
data structure that will incorporate all of these databases. The
database will initially incorporate pollen, plant macrofossil, mammal,
and beetle data. However, the database designed facilitates the
incorporation of all kinds of fossil data.

Various teams of investigators have developed databases for
paleobiological data that have been project or discipline based,
including the four databases to be integrated in this project. However,
long-term maintenance and sustainability have been problematic because
of the need to secure continuous funding. Nevertheless, these databases
have become the established archives for their disciplines and, new data
are continuously contributed. However, because of funding hiatuses, long
spells may intervene between times of data contribution and their public
availability. For example, the plant macrofossil database has not
incorporated any new data since 1999. The number of different databases
and disciplines exacerbates the problem, because each database requires
a database manager. Consolidation of informatics technology helps
address this overhead issue. However, specialists are still essential
for management and supervision of data collection and quality control
for their disciplines or organismal groups.

The purposes of Neotoma are:

* to facilitate studies of ecosystem development and response to climate change
* to provide the historical context for understanding biodiversity dynamics, including
genetic diversity
* to provide the data for climate-model validation
* to provide a safe, long-term, low-cost archive for a wide variety of
paleobiological data.

Site-based studies are invaluable in their own right, and they are the generators of new data. However, much is gained by marshalling data from geographic arrays of sites for synoptic, broad-scale ecosystem studies. In order to carry out such studies efficiently, a queryable database is required. Thus, it is much morethan an archive; it is essential cyberinfrastructure for paleoenvironmental research. The database facilitates integration, synthesis, and understanding, and it promotes information sharing and collaboration. The individual databases have been extensively used for scientific research, with several hundred scientific publications directly based upon data drawn from these databases. This project will enhance those databases and will continue their public access. By integrating these databases and by simplifying the contributor interface, we can reduce the number of people necessary for community-wide database maintenance, and thereby help ensure their long-term sustainability and existence.

## History of the Constituent Databases

### Global Pollen Database

In an early effort, the Cooperative Holocene Mapping Project
(COHMAP Members 1988, Wright et al. 1993) assembled pollen data in the
1970s and 1980s to test climate models. Although data-model comparison
was the principal objective of the COHMAP project, the synoptic analyses
of the pollen data, particularly maps showing the constantly shifting
ranges of species in response to climate change, were revelatory and led
to much ecological insight (e.g. Webb 1981, 1987, 1988).

The COHMAP pollen "database" consisted of a multiplicity of flat files
with prescribed formats for data and chronologies. FORTRAN programs were
written to read these files and to assemble data for particular
analyses. Thompson Webb III managed the COHMAP pollen database at , but
as the quantity of data increased, data management became increasingly
cumbersome. Clearly, the data needed to be migrated to a relational
database management system. Discussions with E. C. Grimm led to the
initiation of the North American Pollen Database (NAPD) at the in 1990.

At the same time in , the International Geological Correlation Project
IGCP 158 was conducting a major collaborative synthesis of
paleoecological data, primarily of pollen, and the need for a pollen
database became painfully obvious. In the forward to the book resulting
from this project (Berglund et al. 1996), J.L. de Beaulieu describes the
role that this project had in launching the European Pollen Database. A
workshop to develop a European Pollen Database (EPD) was held in in
1989. North American representatives also attended, and the organizers
of NAPD and EPD commenced a long-standing collaboration to develop
compatible databases. NAPD and EPD held several joint workshops and
developed the same data structure. Nevertheless, the two databases were
independently established, partly because Internet capabilities were not
yet sufficient to easily manage a merged database. The pollen databases
were developed in Paradox, which at the time was the most powerful RDBMS
readily available for the PC platform. NAPD and EPD established two
important protocols:

* the databases were relational and queryable
* they were publicly available.

As the success the NAPD-EPD partnership escalated, working groups
initiated pollen databases for other regions, including the Latin
American Pollen Database (LAPD) in 1994, the Pollen Database for and the
Russian Far East (PDSRFE) in 1995, and the African Pollen Database (APD)
in 1996. At its initial organizational workshop, LAPD opted to merge
with NAPD, rather than develop a standalone database, and the Global
Pollen Database was born. PDSRFE also followed this model. APD developed
independently, but uses the exact table structure of GPD and EPD. Pollen
database projects have also been initiated in other regions, and the GPD
contains some of these data, including the Indo-Pacific Pollen Database
and the Japanese Pollen Database.

The pollen databases contain data from the Holocene, Pleistocene, and
Pliocene, although most data are from the last 20,000 years. Included
are fossil data, mainly from cores and sections, and modern surface
samples, which are essential for calibrating fossil data. NAPD data are
not separate from the GPD, but rather NAPD is the North American subset
of GPD. EPD has both public and restricted data---a concession that had
to be made early on to assuage some contributors.

### North American Plant Macrofossil Database

Plant macrofossils include plant organs generally visible to the naked
eye, including seeds, fruits, leaves, needles, wood, bud scales, and
megaspores. Synoptic-scale mapping of plant macrofossils from modern
assemblages (Jackson et al. 1997) and fossil assemblages (Jackson et al.
1997, Jackson et al. 2000, Jackson and Booth 2002) have shown the
utility of plant macrofossils in providing spatially and taxonomically
precise reconstructions of past species ranges. Although plant
macrofossil records are spatially precise, synoptic networks of
high-quality sites can scale up to yield aggregate views of past
distributions (Jackson et al. 1997). In addition, macrofossils, with
their greater taxonomic resolution, augment the pollen data by providing
information on which species might have been present, and can resolve
issues of long-distance transport (Birks 2003).

The North American Plant Macrofossil Database (NAPMD) has been directed
by S.T. Jackson at the . Highest priority has been placed on data from
the last 30,000 years, although some earlier Pleistocene and late
Pliocene data are included. The database originated as a research
database for selected taxa from Late Quaternary sediments of eastern
North America (Jackson et al. 1997). In 1994, an effort was initiated
with NOAA funding to build on this foundation to develop a cooperative,
relational database comprising all of , a longer time span, and all
plant taxa.

The structure of NAPMD was adapted from the pollen database and is also
in Paradox. The principal modifications made to the pollen database
structure to accommodate plant macrofossils were those to cope with
different organs from the same species and to deal with the various
quantitative measures of abundance. The database also includes surface
samples, which are useful for interpretation of fossil data.

### FAUNMAP

R.W. Graham, E.L. Lundelius, Jr., and a group of Regional Collaborators
organized a project to develop a database for late Quaternary faunal
data from the , which the U.S. NSF funded in 1990. This project had a
research agenda, and its seminal paper focused on the individualistic
behavior displayed by animal species (FAUNMAP Working Group 1996).

Two FAUNMAP databases exist, FAUNMAP I and FAUNMAP II. Both databases
were coordinated by R. W. Graham and E. L. Lundelius, Jr. and funded by
NSF. Both are relational databases for fossil mammal sites. The data
were extracted from peer-reviewed literature, selected theses and
dissertations, and selected contract reports for both paleontology and
archaeology. Unpublished collections were not included. Data were
originally captured in Paradox but were later migrated to Access.

FAUNMAP I contains data from sites in the lower 48 states that date
between 500 BP and \~40,000 BP. Funding for this project ended in 1994,
with the production of two major publications by the FAUNMAP Working
Group (1994, 1996), as well as numerous other publications by individual
members and by many others who accessed the database on-line. Graham and
Lundelius continued the FAUNMAP project, developing FAUNMAP II with
funding from NSF beginning in 1998. FAUNMAP II shares the same structure
as FAUNMAP I but expands the spatial coverage to include and and extends
the temporal coverage to the Pliocene (5 Ma). In addition, sites
published since 1994, when FAUNMAP I was completed, have been added for
the contiguous 48 states. In all, FAUNMAP I and II contain more than
5000 fossil-mammal sites with more than 600 mammal species for all of
North America north of Mexico that range in age from 0.5 ka to 5 Ma­.

The detailed structure of the FAUNMAP database is described in FAUNMAP
Working Group (1994). Sites identified by name and location were
subdivided into Analysis Units (AU's), which varied from site to site
depending upon the definitions used in the original publications (e.g.,
stratigraphic horizons, cultural horizons, excavation levels,
biostratigraphic zones). All data (i.e. taxa identified and counts of
individual specimens) and metadata (sediment types, depositional
environments, facies, radiometric and other geochronological dates,
modifications of bone) were captured by AU. This structure allows for
the extraction of information at either the level of the site or the
smallest subdivision (AU). The AU permits fine-scale temporal resolution
and analysis. Similar to GPD and NAPMD, FAUNMAP contains archival and
research tables. Similar to the plant macrofossil database, FAUNMAP
contains a variety of quantitative measures of abundance, and presence
data are more commonly used for analysis.

### BEETLE

Many beetles have highly specific ecological and climatic requirements
and are valuable indicators of past environments (Morgan et al. 1983,
Ashworth 2001, 2004). They are one of the most diverse groups of
organisms on earth, and of the insects, perhaps the most commonly
preserved as fossils. Allan Ashworth has assembled a database of fossil
beetles from . The data, which were recorded in Excel, contain 5523
individual records of 2567 taxa from 199 sites and 165 publications.
Metadata include site name, latitude and longitude, lithology of
sediment, absolute age, and geological age. The basic data are similar
to plant and mammal databases---lists of taxa from sites. The metadata
have not been recorded to the extent of the other databases, especially
chronological data, but Ashworth has resolved the taxonomic issues and
has assembled the publications, so that the additional metadata can be
easily pulled together.

## Who Will Use Neotoma?

The existing databases have been used widely for a variety of studies. Because the databases have been available on-line, precise determination of how many publications have made use of them is difficult. In addition, the databases are widely used for instructional purposes. Below are examples of the kinds of people who have used these databases and who we expect will find the new, integrated database even more useful.

* **Paleoecologists** seeking to place a new record into a regional/continental/global context (e.g., Bell and Mead 1998, Czaplewski et al. 1999, Bell and Barnosky 2000, Newby et al. 2000, Futyma and Miller 2001, Gavin et al. 2001, Czaplewski et al. 2002, Schauffler and Jacobson 2002, Camill et al. 2003, Rosenberg et al.
 2003, Willard et al. 2003, Pasenko and Schubert 2004, and many others).
* **Synoptic paleoecologists** interested in mapping regional to sub-continental to global patterns of vegetation change (e.g., Jackson et al. 1997, Williams et al. 1998, Jackson et al. 2000, Prentice et al. 2000, Thompson and Anderson 2000, Williams et al. 2000, Williams et al. 2001, Williams 2003, Webb et al. 2004, Williams et al. 2004, Asselin and Payette 2005).
* **Synoptic paleoclimatologists** building benchmark paleoclimatic reconstructions for GCM evaluation (e.g., Bartlein et al. 1998, Farrera et al. 1999, Guiot et al. 1999, Kohfeld and Harrison 2000, CAPE Project Members 2001, Kageyama et al. 2001, Kaplan et al. 2003).
* **Paleontologists** trying to understand the timing, patterns, and causes of extinction events (e.g., Jackson and Weng 1999, Graham 2001, Barnosky et al. 2004, Martínez-Meyer et al. 2004, Wroe et al. 2004).
* **Evolutionary biologists** mapping the genetic legacies of Quaternary climatic variations (e.g., Petit et al. 1997, Fedorov 1999, Tremblay and Schoen 1999, Hewitt 2000, Comps et al. 2001, Good and Sullivan 2001, Petit et al. 2002, Kropf et al. 2003, Lessa et al. 2003, Petit et al. 2003, Hewitt 2004, Lascoux et al. 2004, Petit et al. 2004, Whorley et al. 2004, Runck and Cook 2005).

* **Macroecologists** interested in temporal records of species turnover and biodiversity and historical controls on modern patterns of floristic diversity (e.g., Silvertown 1985, Qian and Ricklefs 2000, Brown et al. 2001, Haskell 2001).
* **Archeologists** who are studying human subsistence patterns and interactions with their environment (e.g., Grayson 2001, Grayson and Meltzer 2002, Cannon and Meltzer 2004, Grayson in press).
*  **Natural resource managers** who need to know historical ranges and abundances of plants and animals for designing conservation and management plans (e.g., Graham and Graham 1994, Cole et al. 1998, Noss et al. 2000, Owen et al. 2000, Committee on Ungulate Management in Yellowstone National Park 2002, Burns et al. 2003)
* **Scientists** trying to understand the potential response of plants, animals, biomes, ecosystems, and biodiversity to global warming (e.g., Bartlein et al. 1997, Davis et al. 2000, Barnosky et al. 2003, Burns et al. 2003, Kaplan et al. 2003, Schmitz et al. 2003, Jackson and Williams 2004, Martínez-Meyer et al. 2004)
* **Teachers** who use the databases for teaching purposes and class exercises.

# SQL Quickly

SQL (Sturctured Query Language) is a standard language for querying and modifying relational databases. There is an official standard for SQL, statements such as `SELECT` and `WHERE` are common across most SQL implementations, however, individual vendors do maintain proprietary formatting.  Neotoma is implemented using PostgreSQL, which has [extensive documentation online](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html). It is beyond the scope of this document to teach SQL, however, we have included a large number of SQL queries along with the documentation to provide templates for queries, and to help the user understand how to directly work with the database. These queries can by typed or copied and pasted into database tools such as PGAdmin.

Throughout the document we will refer to tables using the format `ndb.tablename`.  Here `ndb` is the schema for most of the data tables within the Neotoma database.  There are other schema, including `apps`, `doi` and `public`, but the data tables themselves are kept in the `ndb` schema.  You can see all available data tables in the `ndb` schema using the [Neotoma database schema website](https://open.neotomadb.org/dbschema).

## SQL Example

The following SQL example lists the number of sites by the geopolitical unit, where the geopolitical unit is a country.  It uses three tables, `ndb.sites`, which contains **site** information, `ndb.geopoliticalunits`, which lists all geopolitical units (countries, provinces, towns, etc.), and a `JOIN` table, which helps to link the `ndb.sites` table to the `ndb.geopoliticalunits` table.

By convention, SQL first defines the output, using the `SELECT` statement.  The `FROM` block is used to explain how the information is brought together, and the `WHERE` (and subsequent blocks) are meant to help filter and aggregate data as generated within the `FROM` block.

Throughput this document we will use `AS` statemements to help us write our SQL queries neatly.  Using `AS` helps us create an alias so that we don't have to write so much in our query.  As much as possible we will use the same aliases for tables throughout this guide.  For example, `FROM ndb.sites AS st` is commonly used, where `st` becomes the alias for the `ndb.sites` table, and stands in for it elsewhere in the query. Often you will see `gpu` used for `ndb.geopoliticalunits`, or `tx` for `ndb.taxa`.  In Postgres SQL it is not neccessary to use the term `AS` (we use it here to make the queries clearer for folks just learning how to use SQL), so it's possible to see things like `ndb.sites st` in place of `ndb.sites AS st`.  Below is an example where both forms are used:

```{r, configConnection, echo = FALSE}
library(RPostgreSQL)
library(jsonlite)
dbLogin <- fromJSON('connect_remote.json')
db <- dbConnect(dbDriver("PostgreSQL"),
                 dbname = dbLogin$dbname, 
                 host = dbLogin$host, 
                 port = dbLogin$port, 
                 user= dbLogin$user, 
                 password= dbLogin$password)
```

### Query {.tabset}

#### SQL Query

```{sql, sampleCall, echo=TRUE, connection=db, output.var="geopoliticalsort"}
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS sites,
  gpu.geopoliticalname, 
  gpu.geopoliticalunit
FROM
  ndb.geopoliticalunits AS gpu
  INNER JOIN ndb.sitegeopolitical AS sgp ON sgp.geopoliticalid = gpu.geopoliticalid
  INNER JOIN ndb.sites st ON st.siteid = sgp.siteid
WHERE 
  gpu.geopoliticalunit = 'country'
GROUP BY
  gpu.geopoliticalid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY sites DESC;
```

#### Output {.active}

```{r}
DT::datatable(geopoliticalsort)
```

## Table Keys

Within tables there are often Keys. A Key may be a **Primary Key** (PK), which acts as a unique identifier for individual records within a table, or they may be a **Foreign Key** (FK) which refers to a unique identifier in another table. Primary Keys and Foreign Keys are critical to join tables in a SQL query. 

In relational databases such as Neotoma you will often have "entity" tables, that represent explicit things (e.g., people, sites), and then tables that express the relationship between entities using foreign keys.  So, for example the table `ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits` expresses the relationship between `ndb.sites` and `ndb.geopoliticalunits`.  Both `ndb.sites` and `ndb.geopoliticalunits` represent entities; a country is a thing, with properties, as is a site.  The `ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits` defines the relationship betwen these things.  It is a table with two columns, one is an FK that refers back to the PK, `siteid`s, in `ndb.sites`, and one is an FK for the primary key of the `ndb.geopoliticalunits`.

Switching to the *SQL Query* tab in the above example will show you that we are using the PK for the `geopoliticalunits`, `geopoliticalid`. It links the complete information in the `ndb.geopoliticalunits` table to the `ndb.sites` table, through a `JOIN` table, that has two columns, the `siteid` that is the PK for `ndb.sites` and the `geopoliticalid` column, that is the PK for `ndb.geopoliticalunits`.  In this way, `siteid` is the PK in `ndb.sites` and an FK in `ndb.sitegeopoliticalunits`.

## Data Types

Neotoma uses several standard SQL data types.  You can find out more about these individual data types in the Postgres [data type documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html).

### Query {.tabset}

#### SQL Query

```{sql, dataTypeCall, echo=FALSE, connection = db, fig.cap="Common data types within the Neotoma database.", output.var="datatypes"}
SELECT LOWER(data_type) AS DataType, count(*) AS columns 
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'ndb' 
GROUP BY data_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

#### Data {.active}

```{r}
DT::datatable(datatypes)
```

# Database Design Concepts

## Sites, Collection Units, Analysis Units, Samples, and Datasets

Fossil data are site based. A `Site <Sites>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} has a name, latitude-longitude coordinates, altitude, and areal extent. In Neotoma, Sites are designated geographically as boxes with north and south latitude coordinates and east and west longitude coordinates. If the areal extent is not known, the box collapses to a point, with the north and south latitudes equal and the east and west longitudes equal. Most of the legacy sites in Neotoma currently have point coordinates. The lat-long box can circumscribe the site, for example a lake, or it may circumscribe a larger area in which the site lies either because the exact location of the site is not known or because the exact location is purposely kept vague. In the case of many legacy sites, the exact location is not know precisely; for example, it may have been described as «on a gravel bar 5 miles east of town». The exact locations of some sites have purposely been kept vague to prevent looting and vandalism.

A `Collection Unit <CollectionUnits>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is a unit from a site from which a collection of fossils or other data have been made. Typical Collection Units are cores, sections, and excavation units. A site may have several Collection Units. A Collection Unit is located spatially within a site and may have precise GPS latitude-longitude coordinates. Its definition is quite flexible. For pollen data, a Collection Unit is typically a core, a section, or surface sample. A Collection Unit can also be a composite core comprised of two or more adjacent cores pieced together to form a continuous stratigraphic sequence. A Collection Unit can also be an excavation unit. For faunal data, a Collection Unit could be as precise as an excavation square, or it could be a group of squares from a particular feature within a site. For example, consider a pit cave with three sediment cones, each with several excavation squares. Collection Units could be defined as the individual squares, or as three composite Collection Units, one from each sediment cone. Another example is an archaeological site, from which the reported Collection Units are different structures, although each structure may have had several excavation squares. The precision in the database depends on how data were entered or reported.

For many published sites, the data are reported from composite
Collection Units. If faunal data are reported from a site or locality
without explicit Collection Units, then data are assigned to a single
Collection Unit with the name «Locality». This is a «quote».

Different kinds of data may have been collected from a single Collection
Unit, for example fauna and macrobotanicals from an excavation, or
pollen and plant macrofossils from a lake-sediment core. A composite
Collection Unit may include data from different milieus, which,
nevertheless, are associated with each other, for example a diatom
sample from surficial lake sediments and an associated lake-water sample
for water-chemistry measurements.

The Collection Unit is equivalent to the Entity in the Global Pollen
Database but was not defined in FAUNMAP. When the FAUNMAP data were
imported into Neotoma, most localities were assigned a single «Locality»
Collection Unit. However, for some localities, the data were assigned to
different Collection Units that were clearly identifiable in FAUNMAP
(see **Figure 1**).

An `Analysis Unit <AnalysisUnits>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is a
stratigraphic unit within a Collection Unit and is typically defined in
the vertical dimension. An Analysis Unit may be a natural stratigraphic
unit with perhaps irregular depth and thickness or it may be an
arbitrary unit defined by absolute depth and thickness. An excavation
may have been dug in arbitrary units, for example 10 cm levels, or it
may have followed natural stratagraphic boundaries, for example the «red
zone» or a feature in an archaeological site. Although Analysis Units
could be designated by an upper depth and lower depth, in Neotoma they
are designated by their midpoint depth and thickness, which is more
convenient for developing age models. Pollen and other microfossils are
typically sampled at arbitrary depths, and although these samples have
thicknesses corresponding to the thickness of the sampling device
(usually 1 cm or less), these thicknesses are often not reported, just
the depths. Different kinds of samples may have been taken from a single
analysis unit, for example pollen, diatoms, and ostracodes. The Analysis
Unit links these various samples together.

In larger excavations, natural stratigraphic Analysis Units may cut
across excavation squares or Collection Units, and the data are reported
by Analysis Unit rather than by Collection Unit. In this case, the
fossil data are assigned to a generic composite Collection Unit named
«Locality», which has the explicitly defined Analysis Units. If the
Analysis Units are not described or reported, then the data are assigned
to a single Analysis Unit with the name «Assemblage». Thus, for a
locality published with only faunal list, the fauna are assigned to a
Collection Unit named «Locality» and to an Analysis Unit named
«Assemblage».

In FAUNMAP, Analysis Units are the primary sample units, and fauna are
recorded by Analysis Unit. In the GPD, Analysis Units correspond to
samples.

`Samples <Samples>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} are of a single data
type from an Analysis Unit. For example, there may be a vertebrate
faunal sample and a macrobotanical sample from the same Analysis Unit;
or there may be a pollen sample and an ostracode sample from the same
Analysis Unit. There can be multiple samples of the same data type from
an Analysis Unit, for example two pollen samples counted by different
analysts. Normally, vertebrate fossils from an Analysis Unit comprise a
single sample; however, if the fossils are of mixed age, individually
dated bones may be treated as separate samples, each with a precise age.
In addition to fossils, samples may also be used for physical
measurements, such as loss-on-ignition. Geochronologic measurements,
such as radiocarbon dates, are made on geochronologic samples.

A `Dataset <Datasets>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} is a set of Samples
of a single data type from a Collection Unit. For example the pollen
data from a core comprise a pollen Dataset. The geochronologic samples
from a Collection Unit form a geochronologic Dataset. Every Sample is
assigned to a Dataset, and every Dataset is assigned to a Collection
Unit. Samples from different Collection Units cannot be assigned to the
same Dataset (although they may be assigned to Aggregate Datasets).

**Figure 1**. Diagram showing the relationships between tables in
Neotoma, the Pollen Database, and FAUNMAP. Because the pollen database
has only pollen, no need exists for Analysis Units, which may have
multiple data types. FAUNMAP does not make a hierarchical distinction
between Collection Units and Analysis Units, and the data for both
Analysis Units and fauna are contained in the Faunal table, although
within the Faunal table, implicit one-to-many relationships exist
between Localities and Analysis Units and between Analysis Units and
faunal data.

## Taxa and Variables

In general, a sample in Neotoma has a list of taxa with some measure of
abundances. The `Data <Data>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table in
Neotoma has fields for SampleID, VariableID, and Value. **Variables**,
which are listed in the `Variables <Variables>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} table, consist of a **Taxon**, referenced in the
`Taxa <Taxa>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table, as well as the
identified **Element,** measurement **Units**, **Context**, and
**Modification**. A Taxon is generally a biological Taxon, but a Taxon
may also be a physical attribute such as loss-on-ignition.

For biological taxa, the **Element** is the organ or skeletal element.
Typical faunal Elements are bones, teeth, scales, and other hard body
parts. Bone and tooth Elements may be specifically identified (e.g.
«tibia» or even more precisely «tibia, distal, left», «M2, lower,
left»). Some soft Elements also occur in the database (e.g. «hair» and
«dung»). For mammals, an unspecified element is «bone/tooth». Elements
for plant macrofossils are the organs identified (e.g. «seed», «needle»,
«cone bract»). Pollen and spores are treated simply as taxon Elements.
Thus, *Picea* seeds, *Picea* needles, and *Picea* pollen are three
different Variables. All three refer to a single entry in the
[Taxa](#_Table:_Taxa) table for *Picea*.

> -   Variable **Units** are the measurement units. For faunal data, the
>     most common are «present/absent», «number of individual specimens»
>     (NISP), and «minimum number of individuals» (MNI). Plant
>     macrofossils have many different quantitative and
>     semi-quantitative measurement Units, including concentrations and
>     relative abundance scales. Measurement Units for pollen are NISP
>     (counts) and «percent». For pollen the preferred measurement Unit
>     is NISP, but for some sites only percentage data are available.
>     *Picea* pollen NISP and *Picea* pollen percent are two different
>     Variables.
> -   Variable **Contexts** for fauna include «articulated»,
>     «intrusive», and «redeposited». A context for pollen is
>     «anachronic», which refers to a pollen type known to be too old
>     for the contemporary sedimentary deposit. Most Variables do not
>     have a specified context.
> -   Variable **Modifications** include various modifications to
>     fossils or modifiers to Variables, including human modifications
>     to bones (e.g. «bone tool», «human butchering», «burned») and
>     preservational and taphonomic modifications (e.g. «carnivore
>     gnawed», «fragment»). Modifications for pollen include
>     preservational classifications such as «corroded» and «degraded».

## Taxonomy and Synonymy

Neotoma does not change or question identifications from original
sources, although taxonomic names may be synonymized to currently
accepted names. Thus, for example, the old (although still valid)
non-standard plant family names such as Gramineae and Compositae are
synonimized to their standard family names terminated with «-aceae»,
viz. Poaceae and Asteraceae. Neotoma has not attempted to establish
complete or comprehensive synonymies. However, the
`Synonyms <Synonyms>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table lists commonly
encountered synonyms. The descriptions of the
`SynonymTypes <SynonymTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`Taxa <Taxa>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} tables contain fuller
discussions of synonymiztions made in Neotoma.

An important feature of Neotoma is that the
`Taxa <Taxa>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table is hierarchical. Each
Taxon has a HigherTaxonID, which is the TaxonID of the next higher
taxonomic rank. Thus, data are stored at the highest taxonomic
resolution reported by the original investigators, but can be extracted
at a higher taxonomic level.

Synonymy presents a challenge for any organismal database, particularly
for one such as Neotoma, which archives data collected for over a
century and which archives extinct taxa, often for which few and
fragmentary specimens exist. Many changes are due to increased
understanding of the diversity within taxonomic groups and of the
phylogenetic relationships within and among groups. Other changes are
due purely to taxonomic rules or conventions set by the International
Code of Botanical Nomenclature (McNeill et al. 2006) and the
International Code of Zoological Nomenclature
(International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 1999). Working
groups representing the different taxonomic groups included in Neotoma
have established appropriate taxonomic authorities:

- Plants -- There is no worldwide authority. The International Plant Names Index[^1] lists validly published names, but a listed name is not necessarily the accepted name for a given taxon. For families, Neotoma follows the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II (2003) and Stevens (2007+), which follows and updates APG II. The APG is an international consortium of plant taxonomists, and the APG classification utilizes the great quantity of phylogenetic data generated in recent years. For lower taxonomic ranks, the various pollen database cooperatives follow appropriate regional floras:
  - North American Pollen Database/North American Plant Macrofossil Database: Insofar as possible, follows the *Flora of North America* (Flora of North America Editorial Committee 1993+); about half of the planned FNA volumes have been published. Otherwise, appropriate regional floras are followed.
  - European Pollen Database: The EPD has a Taxonomy Support Group. In general, nomenclature follows *Flora Europaea* (Tutin 1964-1993).
  - African Pollen Database: The APD has a Committee for Nomenclature, which has produced a list of pollen types with misspellings, synonymy, and nomenclature corrected[^2]. APD nomenclature follows *Enumération des plantes à fleurs d\'Afrique Tropicale* (Lebrun and Stork 1991-1997).
  - Latin American Pollen Database: has a tremendously rich and diverse flora and no comprensive flora is available. Various regional floras are followed.
  - Indo-Pacific Pollen Database: For Australia and adjacent areas follows the *Australian Plant Name Index* (Chapman 1991). For other regions, appropriate regional floras are followed.
  - Pollen Database for Siberia and the Russian Far East Follows *Vascular Plants of Russia and Adjacent States* (Czerepanov 1995).
- Mammals -- For extant taxa, the authority is Wilson and Reeder's (2005) *Mammal Species of the World* . Original sources are followed for extinct species, and the database is considered authoritative.
- Birds -- For North America, the authority is the American Ornithologists' Union *Check-list of North American Birds* (American Ornithologists\' Union 1983).
- Fish -- Follows the *Catalog of Fishes* (Eschmeyer 1998).
- Mollusks -- For North America, follows *Common and Scientific Names of Aquatic Invertebrates from the United States and Canada: Mollusks* (Turgeon et al. 1998).
- Beetles -- Comprehensive manuals do not exist. Original taxonomic authorities are cited, and the database is considered authoritative.

## Taxa and Ecological Groups

In the `Taxa <Taxa>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table, each taxon is assigned a TaxaGroupID, which refers to the `TaxaGroupTypes <TaxaGroupTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table. These are major taxonomic groups, such as «Vascular plants», «Diatoms», «Testate amoebae», «Mammals», «Reptiles and amphibians», «Fish», and
«Molluscs». Also included are «Charcoal» and «Physical variables». 

**Ecological Groups** are groupings of taxa within Taxa Groups, which may be ecological or taxonomic. Ecological Groups are assigned in the `EcolGroups <EcolGroups>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table, in which taxa are assigned an `ecolgroupid`, which links to the `EcolGroupTypes <EcolGroupTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table, and an EcolSetID, which links to the `EcolSetTypes <EcolSetTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

Ecological Groups are commonly used to organize taxa lists and stratigraphic diagrams. For any taxonomic group, more than one Ecological Set may be assigned. For example, beetles may be assigned to a set of ecological groups, such as dung and bark beetles, and to second set based on taxonomy. Vascular plants are assigned to a «Default plant» set comprised of groups such as «Trees and Shrubs», «Upland Herbs», and «Terrestrial Vascular Cryptogams». Default pollen diagrams can then be generated based on a pollen sum of these three groups. Mammals are assigned to a «Vertebrate orders» set.

## Chronology

Neotoma stores both the archival data used to reconstruct chronologies
as well as interpreted chronologies derived from the archival data. The
basic data used to reconstruct chronologies occurs in three tables:
`Geochronology <Geochronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`Tephrachronology <Tephrachronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`RelativeChronology <RelativeChronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
The `Geochronology <Geochronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table
includes geophysical measurements such as radiocarbon,
thermoluminescence, uranium series, and potassium-argon dates. This
table also includes dendrochronological dates derived from tree-ring
chronologies, for example logs in archaeological structures. The
`Tephrachronology <Tephrachronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
table records tephras in Analysis Units. This table refers to the
`Tephras <Tephras>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} lookup table, which
stores the ages for known tephras. The
`RelativeChronology <RelativeChronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
table stores relative age information for Analysis Units. Relative age
scales include the archaeological time scale, geologic time scale,
geomagnetic polarity time scale, marine isotope stages, North American
land mammal ages, and Quaternary event classification. For example,
diagnostic artifacts from an archaeological site may have cultural
associations with a known age ranges, which can be assigned to Analysis
Units. The faunal assemblage from an Analysis Unit may be assignable to
particular land mammal age, which places it within a broad time range.
Sedimentary units may be assigned to particular geomagnetic chrons,
marine isotope stages, or Quaternary events, such as a particular
interglacial. Many of these relative ages have rather broad time spans,
but do provide some chronologic control.

Actual Chronologies are constructed from the basic chronologic data in
the `Geochronology <Geochronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
`Tephrachronology <Tephrachronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, and
`RelativeChronology <RelativeChronology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
tables. These chronologies are stored in the
`Chronologies <Chronologies>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table. A
Chronology applies to a Collection Unit and consists of a number of
Chron Controls, which are ages assigned to Analysis Units. A Chron
Control may be an actual geochronologic measurement, such as a
radiocarbon date, or it may be derived from the actual measurement, such
as a radiocarbon date adjusted for an old carbon reservoir or calibrated
to calendar years. A Chron Control may by an average of several
radiocarbon dates from the same Analyis Unit. Different kinds of basic
chronologic data may be used to assign an age to an Analysis Unit, for
example radiocarbon dates and diagnostic archaeological artifacts. Some
relative Chron Controls are not from one of the established relative
time scales. Examples of these are local biostratigraphic controls,
which may be based on dated horizons from nearby sites. A familiar
example in is the *Ambrosia*-rise, which marks European settlement. The
exact date varies regionally, depending on when settlement occurred
locally. For a given site, the date assigned to the *Ambrosia*-rise may
be based on historical information about when settlement occurred or
possibly on geophysical dating (e.g. ^210^Pb) of a nearby site.

![image2](media/image6.png)For continuous stratigraphic sequences, such
as cores, not every Analysis Unit may have a direct date. Therefore,
ages are commonly interpolated between dated Analysis Units. In this
case, the ChronControls are the age-depth control points for an age
model, which may be linear interpolation between Chron Controls or a
fitted curve or spline.

**Figure 2. Smoothed quick radiocarbon calibration curve. At the scale
of this figure the difference is mostly less than the line thickness.**

Age is measured in different time scales, the two most commn being
radiocarbon years before present (^14^C yr BP) or presumed calendar
years before present (cal yr BP). For a calibrated radiocarbon date,
«cal yr BP» technically stands for «calibrated years before present»,
i.e. calibrated to calendar years. In Neotoma, «cal yr BP» is used for
both calibrated radiocarbon years and for other ages scales presumed to
be in calendar years, viz. dendrochronologic years and other
geochronlogic ages believed to be in calendar years. The zero datum for
any «BP» age is ad 1950, regardless of its derivation. Thus, BP ages
younger than ad 1950 are negative---ad 2000 = ‑50 BP.

![image3](media/image7.png)Ages may be reported in ad/bc age units, in
which case bc years are stored as negative values. If ages are reported
with a datum other than ad 1950 for BP years, the ages must be converted
to an ad 1950 datum or to the ad/bc age scale before entry into Neotoma.
For example, ^210^Pb dates are often reported relative to the year of
analysis; these must be converted to either ad/bc or «cal yr BP» with an
ad 1950 datum.

**Figure 3. An enlarged portion of Figure 2 showing the monontonic
smoothed curve**

Radiocarbon years can be calibrated to calendar years with a calibration
curve. The current calibration curve for ≤26,000 cal yr BP (=21,341
^14^C yr BP) is the INTCAL04 calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2004).
Various programs, both online and standalone, are available for
calibrating individual radiocarbon dates, two of the more popular are
CALIB[^3] (Stuiver and Reimer 1993) and OxCal[^4] (Bronk Ramsey 1995,
2001), both available online for download. Calibration of radiocarbon
years beyond the INTCAL04 curve is more controversial. However, the
Fairbanks0107 curve is available for calibration of radiocarbon dates to
50,000 cal yr BP, the practial limit of radiocarabon dating (Fairbanks
et al. 2005, Chiu et al. 2007), with an online application[^5].

![image4](media/image8.png)Figure 4. Sample ages calculated from the
Neotoma quick calibraton curve vs. ages calculated from traditional age
models.

Calibrated radiocarbon dates better represent the true time scale and
the true errors and probability distributions of the age estimates. In
addition, other important paleo records, notably the ice cores and
tree-ring records, have calendar-year time-scales. Therefore, for
comparison among proxies and records, it is clearly desirable to place
all records on the same time-scale, viz. a calendar-year time-scale.
Although this goal is laudable, most of the data ingested into Neotoma
from other databases is on a radiocarbon time scale. The majority of
assigned ages and almost all the ages from the pollen database are
interpolated ages derived from age models. The proper method for
deriving calibrated ages is to calibrate the radiocarbon dates and then
reinterpolate new ages between these calibrated dates.

Virtually all age models are problematic. A key problem is that most age
models linearly interpolate between age-depth points or fit functions or
splines to points. However, radiocarbon ages are not points, but
probability distributions. Moreover, the probability distributions of
calibrated ages are non-Gaussian. Each calibrated age has a unique
probability distribution, and many are bimodal or multimodal. Various
investigators have used different points, including the intercepts of
the radiocarbon age with the calibration curve and the midpoint of the
1σ or 2σ probability distributon. The former is particularly
inappropriate (Telford et al. 2004b). The 50% median probability is
probably the best single point; however, because of multimodality, this
particular point may, in fact, be very unlikely. Nevertheless, if it
falls between more-or-less equally probable modes, it may still be the
best single point. Most age models for cores are based on relataively
few radiocarbon dates, and the uncertainties of the interpolated ages
are unknown and large (Telford et al. 2004a). Indeed, chronology is
perhaps the greatest challenge for future research with this database.

![image5](media/image9.png)

**Figure 5. Anomalies (Sample ages from Neotoma default calendar-year
age models minus ages calculated with the Neotoma quick calibration
curve) vs. time.**

Given the need for a common age scale and the enormity of the task to
properly develop new age models, a
`RadiocarbonCalibration <RadiocarbonCalibration>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} conversion table was developed to quickly convert sample
ages in radiocarbon years to calendar years. These calibrated ages are
for perusal and data exploration; however, the differences between these
ages and those calculated with traditional age models are relatively
small. The table contains radiocarbon ages from -100 to 45,000 in 1-year
increments with corresponding calibrated values. The table was generated
by smoothing the INTCAL04 calibration curve with an FFT filter so that
the curve is monotonically increasing, i.e. so that there are no age
reversals in calibrated age. The INTCAL04 curve is in 5-yr increments
from -5 to 12,500 ^14^C yr BP, 10-yr increments from 12,500 to 15,000
^14^C yr BP, and 20-yr increments from 15,000 to 26,000 ^14^C yr BP. The
FFT filter was 50 points (250 yr) for the first interval, 25 points (250
yr) for the second interval, and 10 points (200 yr) for the third
interval. For the calibration beyond 26,000 ^14^C yr BP, a calibrated
age was determined with the Fairbanks0107 calibration curve every 100
years with a standard deviation of ±100 years from 20,000±100 ^14^C yr
BP to 46,700±100 ^14^C yr BP. These were then smoothed with a 5-sample
(500-yr) FFT filter. The curve kinks sharply after 45,000 ^14^C yr BP,
so the quick calibration curve was terminated at this date. The
Fairbanks0107 curve diverges somewhat from the INTCAL04 curve for the
portion they overlap in age. From 20,000 to 26,000 ^14^C yr BP, the
difference was prorated linearly from zero divergence from the INTCAL04
curve at 20,000 ^14^C yr BP to zero divergence from the Fairbanks0107
curve at 26,000 ^14^C yr BP. **Figure 2** shows the smoothed curve, and
Error! Reference source not found. shows an enlargement of part of the
curve.

An analysis was made to assess the deviation between ages derived from
traditionally calibrated age models and ages derived from the quick
calibration curve. From the database, 57 default Chronologies in
calibrated radiocarbon years were selected. The Chron Controls were all
calibrated radiocarbon dates, except for top dates, European settlement
dates, and ^210^Pb dates in the uppermost portions of the cores. A few
Chronologies used the Zdanowicz et al. (1999) calendar-year age from the
GISP2 ice core. Ages beyond the reliable age limit
(`Chronologies.AgeBoundOlder <Chronologies>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}) were not used. These 57 Chronologies had a total of 1945
Sample Ages in calibrated radiocarbon years. **Figure 4** shows graph of
ages from the Neotoma age models vs. the ages calculated with the quick
calibration curve. Error! Reference source not found. shows the
anomalies vs. time and **Figure 6** shows a histogram of the
distribution of anomalies. Nearly half (47%) of the anomalies are \<25
years, 86% are \<100 years, 97% are \<200 years, and 99.4% are \<300
years. The average absolute anomaly is 49.2 years, and the median is 29
years. Thus, the quick calibration curve provides remarkably good
results. The ages have no confidence limits, but neither do the
interpolated ages of most age models.

calendar-year age models and ages calculated with the Neotoma quick
calibration curve.

## Sediment and Depositional Environments

Several tables deal with depositional environments, depositional agents,
and sediment descriptions. In Neotoma, the **Depositional Environment**
refers to the Depositional Environment of the site today, for example,
«», «Fen», «Cave», «Colluvial Fan». Depositional Environments may vary
within a Site. For example, a lake with a marginal fen has lake and fen
Depositional Environments. Thus, Depositional Environments are an
attribute of Collection Units and are assigned in the
`CollectionUnits <CollectionUnits>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.
Depositional Environments are listed in the in the
`DepEnvtTypes <DepEnvtTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} lookup
table, and they are hierarchical, for example:

> Glacial Lacustrine

Any of these Depositional Environments may be assigned to a Collection
Unit, but because they are hierarchical, Collection Units may be grouped
at higher levels, for example, all Collection Units from natural lakes.
The top level Depositional Environments, with some examples, are:

-   Archaeological burials, middens, mounds
-   Biological packrat middens, dung, moss polsters
-   Estuarine mangrove swamps, salt marshes
-   Lacustrine lakes and ponds
-   Marine deep sea benthic, coastal bars
-   Palustrine wetlands including fens, bogs, and marshes
-   Riverine river channels, point bars, natural levees
-   Sampler Tauber traps for modern pollen samples
-   Spring tufa deposits, spring conduits
-   Terrestrial caves, rock shelters, colluvium, volcanic deposits,
    soils

The Depositional Environment may change through time. For example, as a
basin fills with sediment, it may convert from a lake to a fen and
perhaps later to a bog. A colluvial slope may have alluvial sediments at
depth. A modern playa lake may have a buried paleosol. Thus, a sediment
section may have units with different facies and depositional agents.
The **Facies** is the sum total of the characteristics that distinguish
a sedimentary unit. Facies are listed in the
`FaciesTypes <FaciesTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} lookup table
and are assigned to Analysis Units in the
`AnalysisUnits.FaciesID <AnalysisUnits>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
field. A sedimentary unit may have one or more agents of deposition. For
example, a cave deposit may be partly owing to human habitation and
partly to carnivore activity. Depositional Agents are listed in the
`DepAgentTypes <DepAgentTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} lookup
table and are assigned to Analysis Units in the
`DepAgents <DepAgents>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

Whereas Facies and Depositional Agents are both keyed to Analysis Units,
the `Lithology <Lithology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table is keyed
to Collection Units. Analysis Units, especially from cores, may not be
contiguous but be placed at discrete intervals down section. Lithologic
units are defined by depth in the Collection Unit. Whereas Facies have
short descriptions and are keyed to the
`FaciesTypes <FaciesTypes>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} lookup table,
the `Lithology.Description <Lithology>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
field is a memo, and lithologic descriptions much more detailed than
Facies descriptions. FAUNMAP, which was built around Analysis Units,
stores Facies and Depositional Agent data; whereas the pollen database,
which was centered on Collection Units, stores lithologic data.

## Date Fields

Neotoma uses date fields in several tables. Dates are stored internally
as a double precision floating point number, which facilitates
calculations and functions involving dates. The disadvantage is that
complete dates must be stored, i.e. year, month, and day; whereas in
many cases only the year or month are known, for example the month a
core was collected. Neotoma had adapted the convention that if only the
month is known, the day is set to the first of the month; if only the
year is known, the month and day are set to January 1. Thus, «June 1984»
is set to «June 1, 1984»; and «1984» is set to «January 1, 1984». The
drawback, of course, is that these imprecise dates cannot be
distinguished from precise dates on the first of the month. However, it
was determined that the advantages of the date fields outweighed this
disadvantage.

# Neotoma Tables


The Neotoma Database contains more than 100 tables and as new proxy
types get added, or new metadata is stored, the number of tables may
increase or decrease. As a result, this manual should not be considered
the final authority, but it should provide nearly complete coverage of
the database and its structure. In particular, do our best to divide
tables into logical groupings: Chronology & Age related tables, Dataset
related tables, Site related tables, Contact tables, Sample tables and
so on.

## Site Related Tables

Tables for key geographic information relating to the dataset.
Specifically geographic coordinates, geo-political units and any
situational information such as images of the site itself.

* [`geopoliticalunits`](GeoPoliticalUnits)

## Dataset & Collection Related Tables

# Taxonomy Related Tables

## ecolgroups {#ecolgroups}

Ecological groups represent a method for organizing or representing taxa.  The ecological group to which a taxon belongs depends both on the taxon and the dataset type.  Taxa are assigned to sets of Ecological Groups. A taxon may be assigned to more than one Ecological Group, representing different schemes for organizing taxa.

  SynonymType                 Text                     
  --------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------

**SynonymTypeID (Primary Key)**

:   An arbitrary Synonym Type identification number.

**SynonymType**

:   Synonym type. Below are some examples:

    **nomenclatural, homotypic, or objective synonym**

    :   a synonym that unambiguously refers to the same taxon,
        particularly one with the same description or type specimen.
        These synonyms are particularly common above the species level.
        For example, Gramineae = Poaceae, *Clethrionomys gapperi* =
        *Myodes gapperi*. The term «objective» is used in zoology,
        whereas «nomenclatural» or «homotypic» is used in botany.

    **taxonomic, heterotypic, or subjective synonym**

    :   a synonym typically based on a different type specimen, but
        which is now regarded as the same taxon as the senior synonym.
        For example, *Iva ciliata* = *Iva annua*. The term «subjective»
        is used in zoology, whereas «taxonomic» or «heterotypic» is used
        in botany.

    **genus merged into another genus**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a genus has been merged into
        another genus and has not been retained at a subgeneric rank.
        This synonymy may apply to either the generic or specific level,
        for example: *Petalostemon* = *Dalea*, *Petalostemon purpureus*
        = *Dalea purpurea*.

    **family merged into another family**

    :   Heterotypic or subjective synonym; a family has been merged into
        another family and has not been retained at a subfamilial rank.
        For example, the Taxodiaceae has been merged with the
        Cupressaceae. This synonymy creates issues for data entry,
        because palynologically the Taxodiaceae *sensu stricto* is
        sometimes distinguishable from the Cupressaceae sensu stricto.
        If a pollen type was identified as «Cupressaceae/Taxodiaceae»,
        then synonymizing to «Cupressaceae» results in no loss of
        information. However, synonymizing «Taxodiaceae» to
        «Cupressaceae» potentially does. In this case, consultation with
        the original literature or knowledge of the local biogeography
        may point to a logical name change that will retain the
        precision of the original identification. For example, in the
        southeastern , «Taxodiaceae» can be changed to «*Taxodium*» or
        «*Taxodium*-type» in most situations. If «Cupressaceae» was also
        identified, then it should be changed to «Cupressaceae undiff.»
        or possibly «Juniperus-type» if other Cupressaceae such as
        Chamaecyperus are unlikely.

    **rank change: species reduced to subspecific rank**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a species has been reduced to
        a subspecies or variety of another species. These synonyms may
        be treated in two different ways, depending on the situation or
        protocols of the contributing data cooperative: (1) The taxon is
        reduced to the subspecific rank (e.g. *Alnus* *fruticosa* =
        *Alnus viridis* subsp. *fruticosa*, *Canis familiaris* = *Canis
        lupus familiaris*), either because the fossils can be assigned
        to the subspecies based on morphology, as is likely the case
        with the domestic dog, *Canis lupus familiaris*, or because the
        subspecies can be assigned confidently based on
        biogeography. (2) The taxon is changed to the new taxon and the
        subspecific rank is dropped because the fossil is not
        distinguishable at the subspecific level. For example, *Alnus
        rugosa* = *Alnus incana* subsp. *rugosa*, but may simply be
        changed to *Alnus incana* because the pollen of *A. incana*
        subsp. *rugosa* and *A. incana* subsp. *incana* are
        indistinguishable morphologically.

    **rank change: genus reduced to subgenus**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a genus has been reduced to
        subgeneric rank in another family. At the generic level, this
        synonymy is clear from the naming conventions, e.g. *Mictomys* =
        *Synaptomys (Mictomys)*; however, at the species level it is
        not, e.g. *Mictomys borealis* = *Synaptomys borealis*.

    **rank change: family reduced to subfamily**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a family has been reduced to
        subfamily rank in another family. By botanical convention the
        family name is retained, e.g. Pyrolaceae = Ericaceae subf.
        Monotropoideae; whereas by zoological convention it is not, e.g.
        Desmodontidae = Desmodontinae.

    **rank change: subspecific rank elevated to species**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subspecies or variety has
        been raised to the species rank, e.g. *Ephedra fragilis* subsp.
        *campylopoda* = *Ephedra foeminea*.

    **rank change: subgeneric rank elevated to genus**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subgenus or other
        subgeneric rank has been raised to the generic rank. At the
        subgeneric level, this synonymy is clear from the naming
        conventions, e.g. *Potamogeton* subg. *Coleogeton* =
        *Stuckenia*; however, at the species level it is not, e.g.
        *Potamogeton pectinatus* = *Stuckenia pectinata*.

    **rank change: subfamily elevated to family**

    :   heterotypic or subjective synonym; a subfamily has been raised
        to the family rank, e.g. Liliaceae subf. Amaryllidoideae =
        Amaryllidaceae, Pampatheriinae = Pampatheriidae.

    **rank elevated because of taxonomic uncertainty**

    :   because the precise taxonomic identification is uncertain, the
        rank has been raised to a level that includes the universe of
        possible taxa. A common cause of such uncertainty is taxonomic
        splitting subsequent to the original identification, in which
        case the originally identified taxon is now a much smaller
        group. For example, the genus *Psoralea* has been divided into
        several genera; the genus *Psoralea* still exists, but now
        includes a much smaller number of species. Consequently, in the
        database *Psoralea* has been synonymized with Fabaceae tribe
        Psoraleeae, which includes the former *Psoralea* sensu lato. A
        zoological example is *Mustela* sp. The genus *Mustela* formerly
        included the minks, which have now been separated into the genus
        *Neovison*. Consequently, *Mustela* sp. = *Mustela/Neovison* sp.

    **globally monospecific genus**

    :   Although identified at the genus level, specimens assigned to
        this genus can be further assigned to the species level because
        the genus is monospecific.

    **globally monogeneric family**

    :   although identified at the family level, specimens assigned to
        this family can be further assigned to the genus level because
        the family is monogeneric.

  ------------------- ---------------- ------ ------------------

**TaxonID (Primary Key)**

:   An arbitrary Taxon identification number.

**TaxonCode**

:   A code for the Taxon. These codes are useful for other software or
    output for which the complete name is too long. Because of the very
    large number of taxa, codes can be duplicated for different Taxa
    Groups. In general, these various Taxa Groups are analyzed
    separately, and no duplication will occur within a dataset. However,
    if Taxa Groups are combined, unique codes can be generated by
    prefixing with the TaxaGroupID, For example, VPL:Cle (*Clethra*) and
    MAM:Cle (*Clethrionomys*)

    A set of conventions has been established for codes. In some cases
    conventions differ depending on whether the organism is covered by
    rules of botanical nomenclature (BN) or zoological nomenclature
    (ZN).

    **Genus**

    :   Three-letter code, first letter capitalized, generally the first
        three unless already used: **Ace** (*Acer*) or **Cle**
        (*Clethrionomys*).

    **Subgenus**

    :   The genus code plus a two-letter subgenus code, first letter
        capitalized, separated by a period: **Pin.Pi** (*Pinus* subg.
        *Pinus*) or **Syn.Mi** (*Synaptomys (Mictomys)*).

    **Species**

    :   The genus code plus a two-letter, lower-case species code,
        separated by a period: **Ace.sa** (*Acer saccharum*), **Ace.sc**
        (*Acer saccharinum*), or **Cle.ga** (*Clethrionomys gapperi*)

    **Subspecies or variety**

    :   The species code a two-letter, lower-case subspecies code,
        separated by a period: **Aln.vi.si** (*Alnus viridis* subsp.
        *sinuata*), or **Bis.bi.an** (*Bison bison antiquus*)

    **Family**

    :   Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three
        letters followed by «eae» (BN) or «dae» (ZN): **Roseae**
        (Rosaceae), or **Bovdae** (Bovidae)

    **Subfamily or tribe**

    :   (BN) Family code plus two-letter subfamily code, first letter
        capitalized, separated by a period. (ZN) Six-letter code, first
        letter capitalized, consisting of three letters followed by
        «nae»: **Asteae.As** (Asteraceae subf. Asteroideae),
        **Asteae.Cy** (Asteraceae tribe Cynarea), or **Arvnae**
        Arvicolinae.

    **Order**

    :   (BN) Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of
        three letters followed by «les». (ZN) Six-letter code, first
        letter capitalized, consisting of three letters, followed by the
        last three letters of the order name, unless the order name is
        ≤6 letters long, in which case the code = the order name.
        Zoological orders do not have a common ending: **Ercles**
        (Ericales), **Artyla** (Artiodactyla), or **Rodtia** (Rodentia).

    **Taxonomic levels higher than order**

    :   Six-letter code, first letter capitalized, consisting of three
        letters, followed by the last three letters of the order name,
        unless the order name is ≤6 letters long, in which case the code
        = the order name: **Magida** (Magnoliopsida), **Magyta**
        (Magnoliophyta), or **Mamlia** (Mammalia).

    **Types**

    :   The conventional taxon code followed by «-type»: **Aln.in-t**
        (*Alnus incana*-type), **Amb-t** (*Ambrosia*-type)

    **cf.**

    :   «cf. » is placed in the proper position: **Odc.cf.he**
        (*Odocoileus* cf. *O. hemionus*), **cf.Odc.he** (cf. *Odocoileus
        hemionus*), or **cf.Odc** (cf. *Odocoileus*).

    **aff.**

    :   «aff. » is abbreviated to «af. »: **af.Can.di** (aff. *Canis
        dirus*)

    **?**

    :   «?» is placed in the proper position. **?Pro.lo** (?\*Procyon
        lotor\*)

    **Alternative names**

    :   A slash is placed between the conventional abbreviations for the
        alternative taxa: **Ost/Cpn** (*Ostrya/Carpinus*), or
        **Mstdae/Mepdae** (Mustelidae/Mephitidae)

    **Undifferentiated taxa**

    :   (BN) «.ud» is added to the code. (ZN) «.sp » is added to the
        code: **Aln.ud** (*Alnus* undiff.), **Roseae.ud** (Rosaceae
        undiff.), **Mms.sp** (*Mammuthus* sp.), or **Taydae.sp**
        (*Tayassuidae* sp.).

    **Parenthetic modifiers**

    :   The conventional taxon code with an appropriate abbreviation for
        the modifier separated by periods. Multiple modifiers also
        separated by periods. Abbreviations for pollen morphological
        modifiers follow Iversen and Troels-Smith (1950): **Raneae.C3**
        (Ranunculaceae (tricolpate)), **Raneae.Cperi** (Ranunculaceae
        (pericolpate)), **Pineae.ves.ud** (Pinaceae (vesiculate)
        undiff.), **Myteae.Csyn.psi** (Myrtaceae (syncolpate, psilate)),
        **Bet.\>20µ** (*Betula* (\>20 µm))

    **Non-biological taxa**

    :   Use appropriate abbreviations: **bulk.dens** (Bulk density),
        **LOI** Loss-on-ignition, **Bet.pol.diam** (*Betula* mean
        pollen-grain diameter).

**TaxonName**

:   Name of the taxon. Most TaxonNames are biological taxa; however,
    some are biometric measures and some are physical parameters. In
    addition, some biological taxa may have parenthetic non-Latin
    modifers, e.g. «*Betula* (\>20 µm)» for *Betula* pollen grains \>20
    µm in diameter. In general, the names used in Neotoma are those used
    by the original investigator. In particular, identifications are not
    changed, although Dataset notes can be added to the database
    regarding particular identifications. However, some corrections and
    synonymizations are made.

    These include:

    -   Misspellings are corrected.
    -   Nomenclatural, homotypic, or objective synonyms may be applied.
        Because these synonyms unambiguously refer to the same taxon, no
        change in identification is implied. For example, the old family
        name for the grasses «Gramineae» is changed to «Poaceae».
    -   Taxonomic, heterotypic, or subjective synonyms may be applied if
        the change does not effectively assign the specimen to a
        different taxon. Although two names may have been based on
        different type specimens, if further research has shown that
        these are in fact the same taxon, the name is changed to the
        accepted name. These synonymizations should not cause confusion.
        However, uncritical synonymization, although taxonomically
        correct, can result in loss of information, and should be
        avoided. For example, although a number of recent studies have
        shown that the Taxodiaceae should be merged with the
        Cupressaceae, simply synonymizing Taxodiaceae with Cupressaceae
        may expand the universe of taxa beyond that implied by the
        original investigator. For example, a palynologist in the
        southeastern United States may have used «Taxodiaceae» to imply
        «*Taxodium*», which is the only genus of the family that has
        occurred in the region since the Pliocene, but used the the
        family name because, palynologically, *Taxodiuim* cannot be
        differentiated from other Taxodiaceae. However, well preserved
        *Taxodium* pollen grains can be differentiated from the other
        Cupressaceous genera in the regin, *Juniperus* and
        *Chamaecyperus*. Thus, the appropriate synonymization for
        «Taxodiaceae» in this region would be «*Taxodium*» or
        «*Taxodium*-type», which would retain the original taxonomic
        precision. On the other hand, the old «TCT» shorthand for
        «Taxodiaceae/Cupressaceae/Taxaceae» now becomes
        «Cupressaceae/Taxaceae» with no loss of information.
    -   For alternative taxonomic desginations, the order may be
        changed. For example, «*Ostrya/Carpinus*» would be substituted
        for «*Carpinus/Ostrya*».

    The database has a number of conventions for uncertainty in
    identification. The uncertainty is included in the taxon name. Thus,
    «*Acer* *pensylvanicum*» and «*Acer* cf. *A. pensylvanicum*» are two
    different taxa.

    **cf.**

    :   Latin *confer*, which means compare. In taxonomy «cf. »
        generally means that the specimen compares well to or is similar
        to the type referred, but the identification is uncertain.
        Uncertainty may arise for a number of reasons. The specimen may
        not be well preserved. It may be nondescript. There may be other
        similar taxa that can not be ruled out. The analyst may not have
        access to a complete reference or comparative collection for the
        group, so other related taxa cannot be excluded with certainty.

    For uncertainty at the species level, the convention in Neotoma is, for example, «*Odocoileus* cf. *O. hemionus*», not

    :   «*Odocoileus* cf. *hemionus*». Placement of «cf. » is important,
        because it indicates the taxonomic level of uncertaintly. For
        example, «*Odocoileus* cf. *O. hemionus*» implies that the
        identification of *Odocoileus* is secure, but that the species
        identification is not; whereas «cf. *Odocoileus hemionus*»
        implies that not even the genus identification is certain. A
        further implication in the latter example is that if the genus
        identification is correct, then the the specimen must also be
        that species, perhaps because of biogeographic considerations.
        Although commonly overlooked, it is also important to indicate
        the proper level of uncertainly in family-genus identifications.
        For example, «Brassicaceae cf. *Brassica*» implies that
        assignment to the Brassicaceae is secure; whereas simply «cf.
        *Brassica*» does not indicate that even the family
        identification is certain.

        In FAUNMAP, the uncertainty is recorded in a separate field from
        the taxon name, and for species it is not discernable whether
        the uncertainty is at the genus or species level. When data were
        imported from FAUNMAP, the «cf. » uncertainty was conservatively
        assigned to the genus level. Thus, if «*Bison bison*» was
        indicated to have «cf. » uncertainty, this record was imported
        as «cf. *Bison bison*» rather than «*Bison* cf. *B. bison*».
        However, in many cases, the uncertainty in the original data was
        probably at the species level.

    **aff.**

    :   «aff. » Latin *affinis*, which means having affinity with, but
        distinct from, the referred taxon. This desgination is often
        applied to a taxon thought to be undescribed. Thus, «aff. *Canis
        dirus*» implies an affinity to *Canus dirus*, but the specimen
        is likely from another species.

    **?**

    :   «?» is used to designate a questionable identification. It may
        indicate even less certainty than «cf. ». An example is
        «?Procyon lotor».

    **Types**

    :   Many pollen taxa are designated as types, e.g.
        «*Ambrosia*-type». A type denotes a morphological type that is
        consistent with the referred taxon, but also includes other taxa
        that are palynologically indistinguishable. For example,
        «*Ambrosia*-type» includes *Ambrosia* and *Iva* *axillaris*. The
        referred name commonly indicates the sporophyte taxon thought to
        be the most probable source of the pollen. An analyst may choose
        a «-type» designation referring to a lower taxonomic rank rather
        than an inclusive higher taxonomic rank because the referred
        taxon is thought to be the source taxon with very high
        probability. For example, in eastern , *Pinus strobus* is the
        only species of *Pinus* subg. *Strobus*, although several other
        species of this subgenus occur in western . Consequently, some
        analysts refer to «*Pinus strobus*-type» rather than «*Pinus*
        subg. *Strobus*». Ideally, a type would comprise a well defined
        universe of taxa, but in practice types are often vaguely
        defined. For example, in eastern «*Populus balsamifera*-type»
        includes a large proportion of *P. balsamifera* and probably
        smaller proportions of *P. tremuloides, P. grandidentata,* and
        *P. deltoides*; whereas «*Populus tremuloides*-type» includes
        larger proportions of these latter three species and a smaller
        proportion of *P. balsamifera*. However, these proportions are
        ill-defined.

    **Alternative taxonomic designations**

    :   In some cases, fossil specimens of two taxa are
        indistinguishable and are more-or-less equally likely. The names
        can then be separated by a slash, e.g. «*Ostrya/Carpinus*»,
        «Mustelidae/Mephitidae». If one taxon is more likely, the
        analyst may choose to use a «-type» designation instead, e.g.
        «*Ostrya*-type». Although the order of alternative names may be
        changed by the database, a «-type» designation is not
        substituted for alternatives. However, the use of more two
        alternatives is discouraged. In cases in which taxonomic
        revisions have reduced the number of speices within a taxon, the
        original universe of species may be retained with the slash
        designation. An example is «Mustelidae», which in older
        literature included the skunks, which have now been placed in
        their own family the Mephitidae; thus «Mustelidae/Mephitidae»
        retains the original set of possible taxa.

    **Undifferentiated taxa**

    :   Lower taxonomic ranks may not be differentiated. The convention
        among palynologists is to specify these by the suffix «undiff.
        ». Thus, «Rosaceae undiff.» designates undifferentiated
        Rosaceae. However, palynologists have inconsistently applied the
        «undiff.» appellation, and the pollen databases established a
        convention that taxa must be mutually exclusive within a
        dataset. Thus, if a higher-rank taxon is present in a dataset,
        the «undiff.» suffix is applied only if lower-rank taxa are also
        present. For example, if «*Spiraea*» occurs in a dataset,
        «Rosaceae» would be changed to «Rosaceae undiff.», because
        *Spiraea* is a genus in the family Rosaceae. On the other hand,
        if «Rosaceae undiff.» occurs with no other Rosaceae, then
        «Rosaceae undiff.» is changed to simply «Rosaceae»; it is
        implicit that the family is not differentiated.

    Faunal analysts customarily use the appellation «sp.» to designate
    undifferentiated taxa. Thus, «*Microtus* sp.» indicates
    undifferentiated *Microtus*. In addition, faunal analysts regularly
    use the «sp.» designation even when no lower-rank taxa are
    identified. The «sp.» appellation is most frequently used with
    genera. The principle of taxonomic mutual exclusivity has not been
    applied to fauanl datasets, although it should probably be
    considered.

**Author**

:   Author(s) of the name. Neither the pollen database nor FAUNMAP
    stored author names, so these do not currently exist in Neotoma for
    plant and mammal names. These databases follow standard taxonomic
    references (e.g. *Flora of North America*, *Flora Europaea*, Wilson
    and Reeder\'s *Mammal Species of the World*), which, of course, do
    cite the original authors. However, for beetles, the standard
    practice is to cite original author names; therefore, this field was
    added to Neotoma.

**HigherTaxonID**

:   The TaxonID of the next higher taxonomic rank, for example, the
    HigherTaxonID for «*Bison*» is the TaxonID for «Bovidae». For
    «cf.\'s» and «-types», the next higher rank may be much higher owing
    to the uncertainty of the identification; the HigherTaxonID for «cf.
    *Bison bison*» is the TaxonId for «Mammalia». The HigherTaxonID
    implements the taxonomic hierarchy in Neotoma.

**Extinct**

:   Boolean (True/False) variable. The value is True if the taxon is
    extinct, False if extant.

**TaxaGroupID (Foreign Key)**

:   The TaxaGroupID facilitates rapid extraction of taxa groups that are
    typically grouped together for analysis. Some of these groups
    contain taxa in different classes or phyla. For example, vascular
    plants include the Spermatophyta and Pteridophyta; the herps include
    Reptilia and Amphibia; the testate amoebae include taxa from
    different phyla. Field links to the
    `TaxaGroupTypes`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

**PublicationID (Foreign Key)**

:   Publication identification number. Field links to the
    `Publications`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

**Notes**

:   Free form notes or comments about the Taxon.

### SQL Example

This query lists the Variables for «*Zea mays*» with elements and
measurement units.

``` {sql, getMeasurements, connection=db}
SELECT 
    tx.taxonname,
    ve.variableelement,
    vu.variableunits
FROM 
               ndb.taxa             AS tx
    INNER JOIN ndb.variables        AS var ON          var.taxonid = tx.taxonid
    INNER JOIN ndb.variableunits    AS vu  ON   vu.variableunitsid = var.variableunitsid
    INNER JOIN ndb.variableelements AS ve  ON ve.variableelementid = var.variableelementid
WHERE tx.taxonname = 'Zea mays'
GROUP BY tx.taxonname, 
         ve.variableelement,
         vu.variableunits;
```

### SQL Example

This query lists all sites with *Zea mays* pollen by designating the
VariableElement as «pollen».

``` {sql, zeaPollenSites, connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT tx.taxonname, 
       ve.variableelement, 
       st.sitename
FROM 
    ndb.taxa AS tx
    INNER JOIN ndb.variables        AS var ON          var.taxonid = tx.taxonid
    INNER JOIN ndb.variableelements AS ve  ON ve.variableelementid = var.variableelementid
    INNER JOIN ndb.data             AS dt  ON var.variableid = dt.variableid
    INNER JOIN ndb.samples          AS smp ON smp.sampleid = dt.sampleid
    INNER JOIN ndb.datasets         AS ds  ON ds.datasetid = smp.datasetid
    INNER JOIN ndb.collectionunits  AS cu  ON cu.collectionunitid = ds.collectionunitid
    INNER JOIN ndb.sites            AS st  ON st.siteid = cu.siteid
WHERE tx.taxonname = 'Zea mays'
  AND ve.variableelement = 'pollen'
LIMIT 10;
```

We can obtain a similar result if we search instead for all records from pollen datasets, as below.  However, it may be the case that pollen is observed and recorded in datasets that are not, strictly speaking, pollen datasets.

``` {sql, ZeapollenByDataset, connection=db}
SELECT DISTINCT tx.taxonname, 
       dst.datasettype, 
       st.sitename
FROM 
    ndb.taxa AS tx
    INNER JOIN ndb.variables        AS var ON          var.taxonid = tx.taxonid
    INNER JOIN ndb.data             AS dt  ON var.variableid = dt.variableid
    INNER JOIN ndb.samples          AS smp ON smp.sampleid = dt.sampleid
    INNER JOIN ndb.datasets         AS ds  ON ds.datasetid = smp.datasetid
    INNER JOIN ndb.datasettypes     AS dst ON dst.datasettypeid = ds.datasettypeid
    INNER JOIN ndb.collectionunits  AS cu  ON cu.collectionunitid = ds.collectionunitid
    INNER JOIN ndb.sites            AS st  ON st.siteid = cu.siteid
WHERE tx.taxonname = 'Zea mays'
  AND dst.datasettype = 'pollen'
LIMIT 10;
```

### SQL Example

This example gives a list of all sites with *Bison bison antiquus* bones
with human butchering.

``` {.sourceCode .sql}
SELECT Taxa.TaxonName, VariableModifications.VariableModification,
Sites.SiteName

FROM Sites INNER JOIN (CollectionUnits INNER JOIN (Datasets INNER JOIN
(Samples INNER JOIN ((VariableModifications INNER JOIN (Taxa INNER JOIN
Variables ON Taxa.TaxonID = Variables.TaxonID) ON
VariableModifications.VariableModificationID =

Variables.VariableID = Data.VariableID) ON Samples.SampleID =
Data.SampleID) ON Datasets.DatasetID = Samples.DatasetID) ON
CollectionUnits.CollectionUnitID = Datasets.CollectionUnitID) ON
Sites.SiteID = CollectionUnits.SiteID

GROUP BY Taxa.TaxonName, VariableModifications.VariableModification,
Sites.SiteName

HAVING (((Taxa.TaxonName)="Bison bison antiquus") AND
((VariableModifications.VariableModification)="human butchering"));
```

Result:

  VariableContext                 Text                     
  ------------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------

**VariableContextID (Primary Key)**

:   An arbitrary Variable Context identification number.

**VariableContext**

:   Depositional context. Examples are:

    **anachronic**

    :   A specimen older than the primary deposit, e.g. a Paleozoic
        spore in a Holocene deposit. The specimen may be redeposited
        from the catchment, or may be derived from long distance, e.g.
        Tertiary pollen grains in Quaternary sediments with no local
        Tertiary source. A Pleistocene specimen in a Holocene
        archaeological deposit, possibly resulting from aboriginal
        fossil collecting, would also be anachronic.

    **intrusive**

    :   A specimen, generally younger than the primary deposit, *e.g*. a
        domestic pig in an otherwise Pleistocene deposit.

    **redeposited**

    :   A specimen older than the primary deposit and assumed to have
        been redeposited from a local source by natural causes.

    **articulated**

    :   An articulated skeleton

    **clump**

    :   A clump, esp. of pollen grains

## VariableElements {#VariableElements}

Lookup table of Variable Elements. Table is referenced by the
`Variables`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

  VariableElement                 Text                     
  ------------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------

**VariableElementID (Primary Key)** An arbitrary Variable Element
identification number.

**VariableElement**

:   The element, part, or organ of the taxon identified. For plants,
    these include pollen, spores, and various macrofossil organs, such
    as «seed», «twig», «cone», and «cone bract». Thus, *Betula* pollen
    and *Betula* seeds are two different Variables. For mammals,
    Elements include the bone or tooth identified, e.g. «tibia». «tibia,
    distal, left», «M2, lower, left». Some more unusual elements are
    *Neotoma* fecal pellets and *Erethizon dorsata* quills. If no
    element is indicated for mammalian fauna, then the genric element
    «bone/tooth» is assigned. Elements were not assigned in FAUNMAP, so
    all Variables ingested from FAUNMAP were assigned the «bone/tooth»
    element. Physical Variables may also have elements. For example, the
    Loss-on-ignition Variables have «Loss-on-ignition» as a Taxon, and
    temperature of analysis as an element, e.g. «500°C», «900°C».
    Charcoal Variables have the size fragments as elements, e.g. «75-100
    µm», «100-125 µm».

## VariableModifications {#VariableModifications}

Lookup table of Variable Modifications. Table is referenced by the
`Variables`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

  VariableModification                 Text                     
  ------------------------------------ ---------------- ------ ------

**VariableModificationID (Primary Key)**

:   An arbitrary Variable Modification identification number.

**VariableModification**

:   Modification to a specimen. Examples of modifications to bones
    include «carnivore gnawed», «rodent gnawed», «burned», «human
    butchering». Modifications to pollen grains include various
    preservation states, e.g. «1/2 grains», «degraded», «corroded»,
    «broken». Most Variables do not have a modification assigned.

## VariableUnits {#VariableUnits}

Lookup table of Variable Units. Table is referenced by the
`Variables`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

  ---------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------
  **Table: VariableUnits**

  VariableUnit                 Text                     
  ---------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------

**VariableUnitsID (Primary Key)**

:   An arbitrary Variable Units identification number.

**VariableUnit**

:   The units of measurement. For fauna, these are «present/absent»,
    «NISP» (Number of Individual Specimens), and «MNI» (Minimum Number
    of Individals). For pollen, these are «NISP» (pollen counts) and
    «percent». Units for plant macrofossils include «present/abesnt» and
    «NISP», as well as a number of quantitative concentration
    measurements and semi-quantitative abundance measurements such as
    «1-5 scale». Examples of charcoal measurement units are
    «fragments/ml» and «µm\^2/ml».

## RepositoryInstitutions {#RepositoryInstitutions}

A lookup table of institutions that are repositories for fossil
specimens. Table is referenced by the
`RepositorySpecimens`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} table.

  ------------------------------------- ---------------- ------ ------

**RepositoryID (PrimaryKey)**

:   An arbitrary Repository identification number. Repositories include
    museums, university departments, and various governmental agencies.

**Acronym**

:   A unique acronym for the repository. Many repositories have
    well-established acronyms (e.g. AMNH = of Natural History); however,
    there is no official list. Various acronyms have been used for some
    institutions, and in some cases the same acronym has been used for
    different institutions. Consequently, the database acronym may
    differ from the acronym used in some publications. For example,
    «CMNH» has been used for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the
    Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and the Cincinnati Museum of
    Natural History. In Neotoma, two of these institutions were assigned
    different acronyms, ones that have been used for them in other
    publications: CM -- Carnegie Museum of Natural History, CLM --
    Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

**Repository**

:   The full name of the repository.

**Notes**

:   Free form notes or comments about the repository, especially notes
    about name changes, closures, and specimen transfers. In some cases,
    it is known that the specimens were transferred, but their current
    disposition may be uncertain.

## RepositorySpecimens {#RepositorySpecimens}

This table lists the repositories in which fossil specimens have been
accessioned or reposited. The inventory in Neotoma is by Dataset, which
is the collection of specimens from a Collection Unit. Occasionally,
specimens from a single Collection Unit have been reposited at different
institutions, in which case multiple records for that Dataset occur in
the table.
